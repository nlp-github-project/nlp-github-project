# NLP Project

For this project, you will be scraping data from GitHub repository README files. The goal will be to build a model that can predict what programming language a repository is, given the text of the README file.

## Deliverables

A well-documented jupyter notebook that contains your analysis
One or two google slides suitable for a general audience that summarize your findings. Include a well-labelled visualization in your slides.
